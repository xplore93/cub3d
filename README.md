### What is cub3d?

This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way

### What we have there?

This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.
